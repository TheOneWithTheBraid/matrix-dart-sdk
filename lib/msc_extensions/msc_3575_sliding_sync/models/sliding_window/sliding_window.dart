// all state events are returned by default, and additional entries FILTER OUT the returned set
// of state events. These additional entries cannot use '*' themselves.
// For example, ["*", "*"], ["m.room.member", "@alice:example.com"] will _exclude_ every m.room.member
// event _except_ for @alice:example.com, and include every other state event.
